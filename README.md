# ApiTemplate
.Net Core Web api template using Dapper ORM

## Architecture

This is an api template following clean architecture pattern. This architecture is based on Microsoft's dotnet 6 conference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkmvnjypENw.
This is the template I personally follow for personal projects.

## Database interface
The database interface is implemented using Dapper micro ORM: https://dapper-tutorial.net/dapper. The DbContext is a custom class based on how EF works.

Feel free to download and open the solution in Visual Studio!
